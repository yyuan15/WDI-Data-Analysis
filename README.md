# WDI-Data-Analysis
Use Quarto to create data science reports and presentations. I analysed a sample of the World Development Indicators dataset, focusing on one year (2022) and 14 variables. The project demonstrates my ability of performing data analysis, generating visualisations, and producing reproducible documents in multiple formats.
