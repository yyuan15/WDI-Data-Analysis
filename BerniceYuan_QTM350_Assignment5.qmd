### Data Analysis

I conducted simple data analysis on the four selected indicators: `GDP per Capita`,` Life Expectancy`, `Unemployment Rate`, and `GDP Growth Rate`. Below is a table that includes descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, min, max). The distributions of these four indicators are also included. See @fig-plot, @fig-plot-2,@fig-plot-3, @fig-plot-4.
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| code-overflow: wrap

df = wdi[['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy', 'unemployment_rate', 'gdp_growth_rate']].dropna()

descriptive_stats = df.describe().transpose()
descriptive_stats = descriptive_stats[['count', 'mean', 'std', 'min', '25%', '50%', '75%', 'max']]
descriptive_stats.columns = ['Count', 'Mean', 'Std Dev', 'Min', '25th Percentile', 'Median', '75th Percentile', 'Max']

display(descriptive_stats) 

```

```{python}
#| label: fig-plot
#| fig-cap: "Unemplotment Plot"
#| echo: true

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.histplot(df['unemployment_rate'], bins=20, kde=True, color='red')
plt.xlabel("Unemployment Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Unemployment Rate")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()


```

```{python}
#| label: fig-plot-2
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "GDP Growth Rate Plot"
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.histplot(df['gdp_growth_rate'], bins=20, kde=True, color='purple')
plt.xlabel("GDP Growth Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of GDP Growth Rate")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

```

```{python}
#| label: fig-plot-3
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "GDP per Capita Plot"

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.histplot(df['gdp_per_capita'], bins=30, kde=True)
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of GDP per Capita")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()


```

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| label: fig-plot-4
#| fig-cap: "Life Expectancy Plot"

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.histplot(df['life_expectancy'], bins=20, kde=True, color='green')
plt.xlabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.ylabel("Frequency")
plt.title("Distribution of Life Expectancy")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
##### Further Analysis 

###### Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy 

In @fig-plot-5, I applied scatter plot to visualize the relationship and calculated the pearson correlation between these two vairables.

```{python}
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy"
#| label: fig-plot-5
#| code-overflow: wrap

df1 = wdi[['gdp_per_capita', 'life_expectancy']].dropna()

# Scatter plot
plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.scatterplot(x=df1['gdp_per_capita'], y=df1['life_expectancy'])
plt.xlabel("GDP per Capita (USD)")
plt.ylabel("Life Expectancy (Years)")
plt.title("Relationship Between GDP per Capita and Life Expectancy")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

# Pearson correlation
correlation = np.corrcoef(df1['gdp_per_capita'], df1['life_expectancy'])[0, 1]
print(f"Pearson Correlation: {correlation:.4f}")

```


**Key Findings:**

* There's a non-linear relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy. The scatter plot indicates diminishing returns:
    + At lower income levels, life expectancy increases sharply with GDP per capita.
    + At higher income levels, the relationship flattens, meaning additional GDP per capita has a smaller impact on life expectancy.
    + This suggests that basic economic growth significantly improves life expectancy in low-income countries, likely due to better healthcare, sanitation, and living standards. However, beyond a certain level, other factors like lifestyle, healthcare quality, and aging play a bigger role.
* The Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.6386 suggests a moderate to strong positive relationship between GDP per capita and life expectancy.
    + This implies that, in general, countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have longer life expectancies.

###### Unemployment Rate vs. GDP Growth Rate
```{python}
#| echo: true
#| fig-cap: "Unemployment Rate vs. GDP Growth Rate"
#| label: fig-plot-6
#| code-overflow: wrap

df2 = wdi[['unemployment_rate', 'gdp_growth_rate']].dropna()

plt.figure(figsize=(8,6))
sns.regplot(x=df2['gdp_growth_rate'], y=df2['unemployment_rate'])
plt.xlabel("GDP Growth Rate (%)")
plt.ylabel("Unemployment Rate (%)")
plt.title("Unemployment Rate vs. GDP Growth Rate")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()

X = df2['gdp_growth_rate'].values.reshape(-1,1)
y = df2['unemployment_rate'].values.reshape(-1,1)

# Perform linear regression
A = np.hstack([np.ones((X.shape[0], 1)), X])  # Add intercept term
coefficients = np.linalg.lstsq(A, y, rcond=None)[0]  # Solve least squares
intercept, slope = coefficients.flatten()

print(f"Linear Regression Equation: Unemployment Rate = {intercept:.4f} + {slope:.4f} * GDP Growth Rate")

```
The data is obtained from the World Development Indicators by the World Bank [@wdi].


**Key Findings**

* The regression equation is 
    $$\text{Unemployment Rate} = 6.8714 + 0.0653 \times \text{GDP Growth Rate}$$

    + The intercept (6.8714) suggests that when GDP Growth Rate is 0%, the expected Unemployment Rate is around 6.87%.
    + The slope (0.0653) indicates that for each 1% increase in GDP Growth Rate, the Unemployment Rate increases by 0.0653%.
*  The regression line shows a slight upward trend, suggesting a very weak positive relationship between GDP Growth and Unemployment. Normally, Okun's Law states that GDP growth should reduce unemployment, but this plot does not show a strong negative correlation.
* Many countries with similar GDP Growth Rates have widely different Unemployment Rates. Some outliers suggest that other factors influence unemployment more than GDP growth alone. 
* The weak relationship could be due to structural unemployment, where economic growth does not directly translate into job creation. [@imf_unemployment]
* Labor market policies, automation, and demographic trends might be stronger drivers of unemployment than short-term GDP fluctuations. [@investopedia]

: Summary {#tbl-1}

 | Indicators | Findings |
|------|-----|
|   GDP per Capita  |   A right-skewed distribution, meaning a few wealthy countries significantly raise the average. Extreme economic disparity between countries.|
| Life Expectancy  |  The distribution is bimodal, with peaks around 60-65 years and 75-80 years.| 
|  Unemployment Rate |   Right-skewed distribution. The peak occurs around 4-6%, suggesting that many economies operate at these levels. Some countries struggle with much higher unemployment rates.|
| GDP Growth Rate | Approximately normal distribution, centered around 0-5% growth. Some extreme cases where GDP growth is highly negative (e.g., recessions) or very high (above 20%).|
|GDP per Capita vs. Life Expectancy | Economic development is strongly linked to life expectancy, but the effect is more pronounced at lower GDP levels.|
| Unemployment Rate vs. GDP Growth Rate | No strong evidence that higher GDP growth reduces unemployment significantly. Other economic and policy factors likely play a larger role. |
